# OBDII-Transceiver
In this project we  design an OBDII transceiver that makes an  interface with the Car’s ECU using the OBDII port and CAN bus,  reads three different PID values related to the vehicle,  has a GPS to indicate to the vehicle’s location,  has an IMU to record the vehicle’s linear and angular acceleration and speed.
